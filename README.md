# Thanks

**Supreme thanks to my wife for helping me brainstorm mechanics, testing theories and playtesting the class in a real adventure. Without the support, we wouldn't have a fun class to play.**

Friends encourging me and coming up with random ideas, some parts of which made it into the class. Y'all are great!

Anyone reaching out to let me know that you're playing, and any opinions/feedback you might have.

MrNegetZ from Path Wars' discord server for finding and pointing out some issues that have since been corrected.
