# Installing the FoundryVTT module

Simply use the FoundryVTT interface to install the module.

If instead you like doing things the hard way, you can copy the link to the `module.json` from the [latest release](https://github.com/intrand/pf2e-lifeblade/releases/latest) and install through the FoundryVTT interface that way.

# Using the module

Some day I will write this, but today is not that day.

Abridged instructions:

1. Open compendium pack

2. Drag class to actor

3. Drag feats and spells, or modify the settings in the browser to include Lifeblade sources
