# Lifeblade Archetype
)

The lifeblade archetype grants powerful effects that tend to use a single action each; it’s a great choice if you have actions to spare.

## Trance

You can tap into the spirits and minds of those around you, and even gain a loose hold on their very life essence. Using these links, you may enter into various trances. At first level, select which essence you feel most connected to. You gain an additional 1st level lifeblade class feat which must have the stance trait.
