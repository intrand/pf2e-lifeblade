<!-- # Roleplaying the Lifeblade -->

## During Combat Encounters...

You enter various stances to heal, protect or bolster your allies. You are nimble and in the front line, eager to disrupt your enemy's plans.

## During Social Encounters...

You see things others seem to overlook. Your seemingly endless knowledge intimidates some.

## While Exploring...

Knowledable in ancient arts, the information you recall so readily is seen as occult in nature to most. Regardless, your allies are glad to have you on their side, rather than the other way around.

## In Downtime...

You study ancient texts, attempt to improve your unique fighting techniques and serve as a guide for tourists, able to cite historical knowledge like you were reading it off of the page.

## You Might...

* Commune with your ancestors in seclusion, seeking their wisdom and guidance.

* Feel a strong sense of duty to your people and loyalty to your friends and companions.

* Do things that are difficult or uncomfortable for others to do, such as stand up to a person who appears to be stronger than yourself.

## Others Probably...

* Are put at ease knowing that you're there to protect them.

# Class Features

You gain these features as a Lifeblade. Abilities gained at higher levels list the levels at which you gain them next to the features' names.

## Ancestry and Background

In addition to the abilities provided by your class at 1st level, you have the benefits of your selected ancestry and background, as described in Chapter 2.

## Initial Proficiencies

At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.

## Trance

You can tap into the spirits and minds of those around you, and even gain a loose hold on their very life essence. Using these links, you may enter into various trances. At first level, select which essence you feel most connected to. You gain an additional 1st level lifeblade class feat which must have the stance trait.

|

## Gambit Spells

In the heat of combat, and while in a trance, you see, hear and feel things that none other can - the very life force of nearby creatures. After striking an opponent, you may perform a gambit, allowing you to manipulate this life force. Gambits are a special type of spell which often require you to successfully strike an enemy before they can be cast. Gambit spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your ancesters, read ancient texts, or otherwise meditate upon the wisdom of the past.

Your gambit spells are occult spells. You become trained in occult spell attacks and occult spell DCs and your key spellcasting ability is Dexterity.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells are found [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=276).

You learn the *tap self* gambit spell, allowing you to tap into your own essence to empower your weapon.

### Gambit Cantrips

Gambit cantrips are special gambit spells that don't cost Focus Points, so you can use them as often as you like. You cannot swap out gambit cantrips gained from lifeblade feats unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining.

## Lifeblade Feats

At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a lifeblade class feat.

## Skill Feats 2nd

At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.

## Skill Increases 2nd

You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.

=

## General Feats 3rd

At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat. General feats are listed in Chapter 5.

## Expert Lifeblade 3rd

Your proficiency ranks for Lifeblade Class DC and Occult spellcasting increases to expert.

## Ability Boosts 5th

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it’s already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.

## Ancestry Feats 5th

In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of feats is in your ancestry’s entry in Chapter 2.

## Master Lifeblade 8th

Your proficiency ranks for Lifeblade Class DC and Occult spellcasting increases to master.

You’ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.

## Weapon Specialization 13th

# Key Terms

You will see the following key terms in many lifeblade class features, feats and spells.

  **Stance:** A stance is a general combat strategy that you enter by using an action with the stance trait, and that you remain in for some time. A stance lasts until you get knocked out, until its requirements (if any) are violated, until the encounter ends, or until you enter a new stance, whichever comes first. After you take an action that has the stance trait, you can't take another one for 1 round. You can enter or be in a stance only in encounter mode.
  **Essence: [Life, Matter, Mind, Spirit]:** Activities with one or more of these traits may only be used while in the Trance of the corresponding essence. For example, you may cast the *boost healing* gambit spell only while in Life Trance. Feats with one or more of these traits may only be taken if you know all of the corresponding trances. For example, you must first take the *matter trance* feat before you may take the *sap heat* feat.
)

## Legendary Lifeblade 16th

Your proficiency ranks for Lifeblade Class DC and Occult spellcasting increases to legendary.

## Greater Resolve 17th

Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.


## Light Armor Mastery 19th

Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.
